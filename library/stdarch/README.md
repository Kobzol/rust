stdarch - Rust's standard library SIMD components
=======

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/actions)


This repository contains the [`core_arch`](crates/core_arch/README.md) crate, which implements `core::arch` - Rust's core library architecture-specific intrinsics.
  
The `std::simd` component now lives in the
[`packed_simd_2`](https://github.com/rust-lang/packed_simd) crate.
